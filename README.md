# Tomo-Api v5 (me-api)

An apollo graphql serve backed by bun+elysiajs to power my personal site (& maybe other endevours)

Contains:

- Info about me
- List of socials
- Employment history
- Last github events
- Songs I last listened to (via. Lastfm)
- ~~My twitter details~~
- ~~My last tweets~~
- ~~Old blogposts~~

Benefit of this version is it should be fairly easy to put in your own data by using the `.env.example` and the `src/modules/personal/index.ts` to make it your own.
